EBUSY is returned explicitly by fuse in the kernel, it is not actually
locked. This is because multiple dentries are not allowed for a single
directory entry (nor are hardlinks) in linux, so when a faced with the
choice of allocating another dentry with another case for the same directory
inode, it just quits with EBUSY. Regular files work because another dentry
with the exact case is allocated and points to the same inode, which is
allowed.

You can work around this by commenting out these two lines of code in dir.c,
but I'm afraid this will result some race conditions and/or other nastiness
in the kernel eventually.

Bottom line is the fuse kmod needs to be patched to support case insensitive
directory names, and I am not quite sure how to do it the right way. Anyone?

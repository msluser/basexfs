Alright.  I was asking because I would like to relate calls to open and
release 1:1 (in a scenario of logging calls and replaying these logs in
a test bed).  Previously I believed that with the fd alone I could not
do that - which is why I was interested in a non-zero value for pid.
Now it seems that I actually could relate these calls by just looking at
the file descriptors as they all belong to the FUSE process and are
therefore unique (until closed and re-used).

Best,



Sebastian

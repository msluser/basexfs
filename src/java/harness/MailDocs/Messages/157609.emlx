Regular files working case insensitive because multiple dentries are allows
is not the right thing to do. My conclusion is that case insensitive is not
suported by FUSE as-is and just works coincidentally most of the time. I
believe something like what is done in cifs/dir.c will have to be
implemented, fuse's own dentry_operations table with case insensitive dcache
functions that are used with an explicit case insensitive flag set by the
FUSE filesystem.

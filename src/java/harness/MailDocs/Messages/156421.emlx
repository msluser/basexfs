yes /etc/mtab is a symlink to /proc/self/mounts because its a embedded =

distro with a readonly /etc dir

just i have disabled mtab support in fuse and ntfs-3g but it seems it =

will be still used:
lstat("/etc/mtab", {st_mode=3DS_IFLNK|0777, st_size=3D17, ...}) =3D 0

thats i know and it was only for this sample, normally it will be =

mounted via udisks which creates a dir in /media and mounts there

All of the data generated in your IT infrastructure is seriously valuable.
Why? It contains a definitive record of application performance, security =

threats, fraudulent activity, and more. Splunk takes this data and makes =

sense of it. IT sense. And common sense.

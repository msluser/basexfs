Hi!
I've sent this to the callbackFS guys and thought you might be interested as well.
Have you guys seen the continuation of Oracle's patent 7418435? Patent 7418435 can be found here: 
http://www.google.com/patents?id=vw2tAAAAEBAJ&pg=PA23&dq=filesystem+access+multi-model&hl=en&ei=kFoQTs2yEcnNswac-_n3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false 

The continuation, which is still just in the application state,can be found here: 
http://www.google.com/patents?id=RHOtAAAAEBAJ&pg=PA20&dq=filesystem+access+multi-model&hl=en&ei=X1sQTvTaC8zrsgaAhIzaDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false

What differs is the most important part, the claims: 
First revision (already issued patent): 
Claim #1 only refers to OS file systems which means (according to my layman interpretation) that people who use CallbackFS, FUSE for seamless database integration etc do not infringe on it since they implement their own file system FUSE style, ie in user space. 

The continuation, ie the patent application re-phrases this in claims #1 and #2 to 'a file system API' more or less, which means that customers of yours, may later be held liable for intrusion they have already made; in the case their patent is let through. 

The only reason for making this re-phrase, if you ask me, is that they realized there was a giant loop hole in their patent given the user space file systems you and FUSE and a lot more had begun implementing. 

So to the interesting part. The date the continuation was filed is: 
Application number: 12/122,517 
Publication number: US 2008/0215528 A1 
Filing date: May 16, 2008 

Whereas a discussion on this very forum way back in 2007 already discusses user space file systems seamlessly connected to databases. Here: 
http://www.eldos.com/forum/read.php?FID=13&TID=499 

What's your take on this bogus continuation? I say make a lot of noice...

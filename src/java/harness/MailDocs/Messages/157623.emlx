It "works" but it's not the "right thing" to do. Worst case you end up with
2^n (n=strlen) dentry's for a single inode, where you should have had 1
dentry.

syscall's come in with a path name not an inode, which is the whole purpose
of the dcache and dentry's in the kernel. So this has to be done in the
kernel/fuse kmod.

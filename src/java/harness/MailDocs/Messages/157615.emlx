Great ! Thank you for the long awaited explanation.

Hope this is not true for plain files. Case insensitive names
are much similar to hard links, and I have been using
case insensitive file names and hard links with no problem
(at the low level interface only).

If some case insensitive processing had to be added to fuse,
it would have to callback the file system. At least NTFS has
to rely on on-disk uppercase tables, obviously unknown to
fuse. I would much prefer the inode number to be used for
deciding whether two names point to the same directory
(or a file, should this be needed).
